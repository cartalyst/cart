# Collections

Cart uses Collections to facilitate the heavy duty of handling data.

As an example, the entire Cart is a Collection and each item is
an individual Collection.

These Collections extends the 'native' Laravel 4 Collection class, so all
methods you know from this class can also be used on your shopping cart.
