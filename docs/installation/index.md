# Install & Configure

You can use Cartalyst's Cart package both with Laravel 4 and outside by installing the package through Composer.

- [Install through Composer]({url}/installation/composer)
- [Install in Laravel 4]({url}/installation/laravel-4)

## Requirements {#requirements}

Like most of our packages, Cart has the same requirements as Laravel 4. Since Sentry is framework agnostic the following is required.

- PHP >= 5.3.0
