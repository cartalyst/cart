# Introduction

A framework agnostic shopping cart package featuring multiple cart instances and item variants.

The package follows the FIG standard PSR-0 to ensure a high level of
interoperability between shared PHP code and is fully unit-tested.

## Getting started

The package requires at least PHP version 5.3 and comes with a Laravel 4 Facade
and Service Providers to simplify the optional framework integration.
