# Cart

[![Build Status](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/svg/1)](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/view/1)

A framework agnostic shopping cart package featuring multiple cart instances, item attributes and [Conditions](https://cartalyst.com/manual/conditions).

The package requires PHP 5.4+ and comes bundled with a Laravel 4 and Laravel 5 Facade and a Service Provider to simplify the optional framework integration and follows the FIG standard PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code and is fully unit-tested.

Part of the Cartalyst Arsenal & licensed [Cartalyst PSL](license.txt). Code well, rock on.
